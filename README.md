# world-flag-flashcards

## Project details
While watching the 2022 world cup I realized I didn't recognize a lot of international flags, so I created a world flag flashcard app with multiple choice options and score tracking. Its a simple app but fun app, created with HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, and a third party API from www.CountryFlagsAPI.com.
